# Blockchain and Asset Management

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

    Enzyme Finance

* When was the company incorporated?

    2016

* Who are the founders of the company?
    
    Mona El Isa and Rito Trinkler

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    The founders aim was to decentralize traditional asset management. In the industry, barriers to entry have become quite substantial because of evolving regulation, capital requirements, security, and well established goliaths that can compete by fee compression.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

    Enzyme Finance was initially funded via ICO in 2017 (MLN Token), raising $2.90 million.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

    There are two specific problems inherent to the asset management industry:

    1. Barriers to entry have created an industry dominated by large institutions
    2. Many of these large institutions require "minimum investments" that are often out of reach for your everyday individual or family
    
    Enzyme Finance is attempting to solve these problems by decentralizing asset management. Creating a more equal playing field for both asset managers, and their customers. Users do not need to be high net worth individuals to participate, and asset managers do not have to deal with cumbersome compliance, regulation, or capital requirements.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    Enzyme's intended customers are both individual investors, and asset managers.  The asset management industry grew to over $100 trillion by the end of 2020.  In today's market environment, fee compression is where the majority of asset managers compete.  With interest rates near 0%, fixed-income is all but obsolete, and yet inflows into bonds continues to grind higher. Without new products, there is very little to differentiate one asset manager from another.  Equities, bonds, and housing, three of the most common assets, are all at or near all time highs. Without new products or fee compression, there is not much else for asset managers to compete on. 

    Enzyme Finance offers asset managers a chance start their own fund from scratch, without having to deal with unncessary red tape. Further, it also allows investors to pick and choose funds that fit their objectives. Enzyme offers access to a broad range of crypto assets that may be difficult for your typical asset manager to offer.  Enzyme provides *access* to new, innovative products that traditional players in the asset management space cannot offer, and more importantly, it connects investors and asset managers on a more intimate level.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

    Enzyme Finance is a protocol built on top of Ethereum. They leverage connections into DeFi including lending protocols such as Compound and Aave, DEXs such as Uniswap,  and synthetic assets found on the Synthetix protocol.


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

    Asset management

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    One of the major trends in asset management has been consolidation. We continue to see large firms acquire smaller competitors and then use their scale to help reduce costs. With greater cost reduction, the larger firms are then able to compress their fees to put further pressure on smaller boutiques.  With rates near 0%, it is becoming more and more difficult for asset managers to justify large fees.
    
    On the innovation front, many asset managers have become tech heavy.  Trading algos allow asset managers to operate with fewer traders and one solid software developer/coder can automate a great deal of back office operations.  Some asset management firms almost look more like tech firms than your traditional asset manager. This shift towards tech is also a great way for firms to substantially reduce their overhead.


* What are the other major companies in this domain?
    1. Blackrock
    2. Vangaurd
    3. Fidelity
    4. Goldman Sachs
    5. JPM

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    The business impact of Enzyme Finance has been minimal thus far. It is still in it's infancy and has a long way to go. Currently, Enzyme provides access to crypto and DeFi, but struggles to provide access to equity and bond exposure (there is SOME with use of Synthetix). This may, or may not change in the future. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

    Enzyme is not a traditional player in the asset management space. They are more of an aggregator between investors and fund managers. However, one key metric in the industry is simply assets under management. Currently, Enzyme only has $128 million under management. When you compare this to Blackrocks AUM of almost $10 trillion, Enzyme is clearly a long way off. *However*, when you look at growth YTD, you see that Enzyme had $201, yes two hundred and one dollars, as of January 18th 2021. By all measures of succes, Enzyme is heading in the right direction.



## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    With the current NFT craze, I would recommend Enzyme develops a way for people to start an "NFT Fund" where fund managers can purchase and sell NFTs in the marketplace, and investors can gain exposure to NFTs on a diversified basis through fractional ownership.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    This would benefit Enzyme by rounding out their current offerings, and lure new investors to their protocol.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    Blockchain and non-fungible tokens
